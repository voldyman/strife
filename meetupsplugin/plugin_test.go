	`What: Drink N Draw Pumpkin Spice edition
	When: Saturday Sept 24th, 2 pm onward (early birds welcome early for extra chill crafting time) 
	Where: South East corner of Trout Lake/John Hendry Park, same location as before, exact location will be posted day of. 
	
	* no rain so we'll be at Trout Lake, but it rained last night so bring a chair if you can or a blanket if you can't. I'm bringing a tarp *
	
	Will the good weather last?  Let's see! Come hang out in the park, do some arts n crafts, drink some beverages, play some games. Bring a knitting, drawing, painting or other project, or use some of the art supplies provided! If you can, bring a camping chair or blanket to sit. Anyone who would like to bring a game, music or food is encouraged to do so! 
	
	If the weather is good and we are in the park, I'm going to bring some air dry clay for people interested in sculpting (will be a bit messy).
